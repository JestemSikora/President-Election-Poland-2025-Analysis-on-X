## Description

In this project, I will analyze the popularity of each candidate and determine which gender is most active on platform X.

* Scrape tweets from platform X and save them to a CSV file.
* Scrape the names of each candidate and every political party to remove them from the scraped data (we want voters’ opinions).
* Clean the data by removing duplicates and percentage signs to focus on sentiments.
* Create plots based on the cleaned data to visualize each candidate’s popularity.
* Use this dataset to predict users’ gender.
* Build a classification model to predict gender.
